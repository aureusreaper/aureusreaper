*"align my heart, my body, my mind."*

(unfortunately, this is for pony town)

my name is either eli or garion, but i'm known elsewhere as: _grimescholar, wickerkitti, aureus_reaper,_ and _basementbot_

i am a cisgender lesbian (she/her pronouns only please)

i don't kin, before people ask me for a kinlist



i like:

- library of ruina / lobotomy corporation (i founded the red mist hateclub /JOKE)
- lizards/reptiles (i know nothing about reptile husbandry though because i don't own one)
- warrior cats (mostly the fan content)
- fantasy creatures (especially dragons)
- pony town (sometimes)
- general ideas of fantasy creature civilization
- loud music (it clears my brain)
- scaring people (i am somehow intimidating)

i'm found wherever people are if you want to look for me.





- shout out to my wife she's great
